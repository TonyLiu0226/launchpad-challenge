# General outline of the repository
description.txt will contain a description of my thought process on how to address the problem, specifically regarding how to modify the code for smartphone resolutions.
I have also included a small code example demonstrating my thought process on a simple navbar component, the code for that example is in the two files, main.html and main.css
